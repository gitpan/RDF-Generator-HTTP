NAME
    RDF::Generator::HTTP - Generate RDF from a HTTP message

SYNOPSIS
       use LWP::UserAgent;
       my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
       my $response = $ua->get('http://metacpan.org/');

       use RDF::Generator::HTTP;
            use RDF::Trine qw(iri);
            my $g = RDF::Generator::HTTP->new(message => $response,
                                         graph => iri('http://example.org/graphname'),
                                         blacklist => ['Last-Modified', 'Accept']);
            my $model = $g->generate;
       print $model->size;

DESCRIPTION
  Constructor
    `new(%attributes)`
        Moose-style constructor function.

  Attributes
    These attributes may be passed to the constructor.

    `message`
        A HTTP::Message (or subclass thereof) object to generate RDF for.
        Required.

    `blacklist`
        An `ArrayRef` of header field names that you do not want to see in the
        output.

    `whitelist`
        An `ArrayRef` of the only header field names that you want to see in
        the output. The whitelist will be ignored if the blacklist is set.

    `graph`
        You may pass an optional graph name to be used for all triples in the
        output. This must be an object of RDF::Trine::Node::Resource.

    `ns`
        An URI::NamespaceMap object containing namespace prefixes used in the
        module. You should probably not override this even though you can.

  Methods
    The above attributes all have read-accessors by the same name.
    `blacklist`, `whitelist` and `graph` also has writers and predicates,
    which is used to test if the attribute has been set, by prefixing `has_`
    to the attribute name.

    This class has two methods:

    `generate ( [ $model ] )`
        This method will generate the RDF. It may optionally take an
        RDF::Trine::Model as parameter. If it exists, the RDF will be added to
        this model, if not, a new Memory model will be created and returned.

    `ok_to_add ( $field )`
        This method will look up in the blacklists and whitelists and return
        true if the given field and value may be added to the model.

NOTES
  HTTP Vocabularies
    There have been many efforts to create HTTP vocabularies (or ontologies),
    where the most elaborate and complete is the HTTP Vocabulary in RDF 1.0
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF/>. Nevertheless, I decided not to
    support this, but rather support an older and much less complete
    vocabulary that has been in the Tabulator
    <https://github.com/linkeddata/tabulator-firefox> project, with the
    namespace prefixes <http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http#> and
    <http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph#>. The problem of modelling HTTP is that
    headers modify each other, so if you want to record the HTTP headers so
    that they can be used in an actual HTTP dialogue afterwards, they have to
    be in a container so that the order can be reconstructed. Moreover, there
    is a lot of microstructure in the values, and that also adds complexity if
    you want to translate all that to RDF. That's what the former vocabulary
    does. However, for now, all the author wants to do is to record them, and
    then neither of these concerns are important. Therefore, I opted to go for
    a much simpler vocabulary, where each field is a simple predicate. That is
    not to say that the former approach isn't valid, it is just not something
    I need now.

BUGS
    This is a very early release, but it works for the author.
